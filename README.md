# Blackburn launcher

Let Sargeant Blackburn play Battlefield 3 singleplayer without Battlelog.

## Goal

- [x] To run Battlefield 3 on Linux (on Single Player)
- [x] Open-source alternative of launching Battlefield 3 (on Single Player, duh?)
- [x] Part of "Stop Killing Games" initiative
- [ ] Host on any server

## Disclaimer

I have no right to cirvumvent any implementation from Battlelog or any service provided by DICE, Electronmic Arts, Uprise, etc.

I have no goal or intention to replace launchers for Multiplayer. This is just a simple web-based portal to replace old & crusty portal in Battlelog.

## Requirements

- Steam copy of Battlefield 3
- Windows whatever (not Vista)
- NodeJS
